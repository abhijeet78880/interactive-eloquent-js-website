                    The JavaScript language provides a number of values. These values are the literals that are assigned
                    to a variable or binding. Values can be of different kinds, such as integer types, character types,
                    boolean types and strings.
                    Though all values
                    are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has a type that de-
                    termines its role. There are six basic types of values in JavaScript: numbers,
                    strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.
                    To create a value, you must merely invoke its name. This is conve-
                    nient. You donâ€™t have to gather building material for your values or pay
                    for them. You just call for one, and woosh, you have it. They are not created
                    from thin air, of course. Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you
                    want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out
                    of bits. Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultane-
                    ously. As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind
                    its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.
                    This chapter introduces the atomic elements of JavaScript programs,
                    that is, the simple value types and the operators that can act on such values
